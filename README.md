This git repo contains my source code of the four programming assignments for the course CSC501 OS, which is taught by Dr. Vincent W. Freeh(http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/vwfreeh), at the Computer Science Department of NCSU.

I get 100 for P1 and P4, 97 for P2, 99 for P3. P1 is a simple multi-thread lib based on ucontext; P2 is a simple shell; P3 is a simple client-server networking program; P4 is a simple ramdisk based on FUSE. In order to run P4, you must have FUSE on your machine; depending on the version of FUSE, the compilation option might differ, if you cannot compile P4 on your machine, just goole the error and adopt another compiling option.

This code is only for reference and communication. You are welcome to download, study. If you find errors or bugs, please feel free to contact me. However, you should not copy it as your own assignment submission. If you did it, you'll be caught cheating, and you should bear all the responsibility.
